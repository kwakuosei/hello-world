# hello-world
My introduction to Github!
My name is Kwaku Osei

I'm a serial entrepreneur that has recently been knocked down and was out, but is getting back up...after this last fall I was afraid & sad, but now I realize that falls and defeats can be the best things that ever happen to you if you allow them to be, they truly are what make you stronger...to know that you've dared bravely and though fell short you still went out there!

I've had more failure in my life perhaps than success, but I also have more than enough proof that I'm smart enough, good enough, etc. now the question is am I willing to work hard enough?

Well after this last fall I've been running away from work, but I remembered that I have a HUGE vision that I want to see become a reality and so now I'm running towards work...remembering how to work again (as silly as that sounds)...remembering how to learn again (even sillier perhaps) but doing what it takes to succeed is important to me, so yeah my answer to the question above is TBD, but I am TBD and I am very much determined now!

Previous successes - graduating from college magna cum laude, Pre-MBA programs at HBS and Yale SOM (could have chosen to go to either), Deloitte Consulting (though it sucked and I sucked there), working directly w/ Dan Gilbert (of Cleveland Cavaliers, QL, and Detroit fame), co-founding a company w/ Dan G., co-founding Privileged Kid, building a music studio, Cleareer, etc. etc.

If you haven't heard of me until now, rest assure you'll be seeing my name again
